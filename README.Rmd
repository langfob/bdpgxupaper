# bdpgxupaper

This package bundles together the code for running experiments demonstrating the Xu biodiversity problem generator.

Explaining, demonstrating, and using the Xu biodiversity problem generator is more than easily fits in a single understandable paper.  This package encapsulates the code used for just the first paper, which explains and demonstrates the generator.  The package is intended to document what is done in the paper and is not likely to be used by anyone other than the authors, though nothing prevents that use.

## Installation  
You can install bdpgxupaper from github with:  
```R
# install.packages ("devtools")  
devtools::install_github ("langfob/bdpgxupaper")
```
