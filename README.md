bdpgxupaper
===========

This package bundles together the code for running experiments demonstrating the Xu biodiversity problem generator.

Explaining, demonstrating, and using the Xu biodiversity problem generator is more than easily fits in a single understandable paper. This package encapsulates the code used for just the first paper, which explains and demonstrates the generator. The package is intended to document what is done in the paper and is not likely to be used by anyone other than the authors, though nothing prevents that use.

Installation
------------

You can install bdpgxupaper from github with:

``` r
# install.packages ("devtools")  
devtools::install_github ("langfob/bdpgxupaper")
```

Debugging
---------

No matter what problem you're having while using tzar emulation, look first to see if R/model.R exists. If it does, then delete it and retry whatever you're doing (e.g., running runtip() or doing a Build, etc.) The presence of model.R (instead of having it built automatically from model.R.tzar) seems to cause all kinds of strange errors whose messages make no mention at all of model.R and lead you astray.
